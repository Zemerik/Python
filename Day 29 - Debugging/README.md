# Day 29: Debugging

## What You'll Learn:
- Using Python Debugger (pdb)
- Setting breakpoints and stepping through code
- Configuring logging module
- Logging levels and handlers
- Crash investigation techniques

## Files:
1. `pdb_example.py` - Debugger usage
2. `logging_config.py` - Logging setup
3. `advanced_debugging.py` - Post-mortem debugging
4. `error_handling.py` - Structured logging

## Exercises:
1. Debug a faulty function that:
   - Miscalculates factorial values
   - Fails on specific inputs
   - Use pdb to identify logic errors

2. Implement logging in a file processor:
   - Track file operations with different log levels
   - Capture exceptions with tracebacks
   - Rotate logs when they reach 1MB
