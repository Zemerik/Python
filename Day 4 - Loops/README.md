# Day 4: Loops

## What You'll Learn:
- `for` loops and iterating over sequences
- `while` loops for repeated execution
- Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `else`)

## Files:
1. `for_loop.py` - Basic for loop usage with lists/strings
2. `while_loop.py` - While loop with condition checking
3. `loop_control.py` - Using break/continue statements

## Exercises:
1. Create a number guessing game where players get 5 attempts to guess a secret number between 1-20
2. Build a multiplication table generator that:
   - Takes an integer input N
   - Prints tables from 1x1 to NxN
   - Formats output in rows and columns
