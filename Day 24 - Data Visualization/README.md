# Day 24: Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## What You'll Learn:
- Creating basic plots (line, bar, scatter)
- Customizing plots with labels/styles
- Working with subplots and figures
- Advanced visualizations (histograms, boxplots)
- Saving plots to files

## Files:
1. `basic_plots.py` - Line/bar/scatter plots
2. `plot_customization.py` - Styling options
3. `subplots.py` - Multiple plot arrangements
4. `advanced_plots.py` - Statistical visualizations

## Exercises:
1. Create a sales report visualization that:
   - Shows monthly sales trends (line plot)
   - Compares product performance (bar chart)
   - Highlights top-selling days (scatter plot)

2. Build a weather data analyzer that:
   - Displays temperature distributions (histogram)
   - Compares rainfall across months (boxplot)
   - Creates a heatmap of temperature correlations
